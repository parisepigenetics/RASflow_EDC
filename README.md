# RASflow_EDC

<small>Maintained by [Magali Hennion](mailto:magali.hennion@u-paris.fr). 

Implemented by [BiBs-EDC](https://parisepigenetics.github.io/bibs/), this workflow for RNA-seq data analysis is based on RASflow which was originally published by [X. Zhang](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-3433-x). It has been modified to run effectively on both IFB and iPOP-UP clusters and to fit our specific needs. Moreover, several tools and features were added, including a comprehensive report, as well as the possibility to incorporate the repeats in the analysis. If you encounter troubles or need additional tools or features, you can create an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/parisepigenetics/RASflow_EDC/issues), email directly [BiBs](mailto:bibsATparisepigenetics.com), or pass by the 329 room.
