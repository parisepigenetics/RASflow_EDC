# Project name
PROJECT: Awesome_experience
# ================== Control of the workflow ==================

## Do you want to download FASTQ files from public from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) ? 
SRA: no  # "yes" or "no". If set to "yes", the workflow will stop after the QC to let you decide whether you want to trim your raw data or not. In order to run the rest of the workflow, you have to set it to "no".

## Do you need to do quality control?
QC: yes  # "yes" or "no". If set to "yes", the workflow will stop after the QC to let you decide whether you want to trim your raw data or not. In order to run the rest of the workflow, you have to set it to "no".

## Do you need to do trimming?
TRIMMED: yes  # "yes" or "no"? 

## Do you need to do mapping and feature counting?
MAPPING: yes # "yes" or "no"

## Which mapping reference do you want to use? Genome or transcriptome?
REFERENCE: genome  # "genome" or "transcriptome", I haven't implemented transcriptome yet.

## Do you want to study the repeats?
REPEATS: yes # "yes" or "no"

## Do you want to do Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)?
DEA: yes  # "yes" or "no"

# ================== Shared parameters for some or all of the sub-workflows ==================

## key file if the data is stored remotely, otherwise leave it empty
KEY: 

## the path to fastq files
READSPATH: /shared/projects/YourProjectName/Raw_fastq  # for testing purpose we put here the relative paths, but we recommend to always use full paths such as /shared/projects/YourProjectName/Raw_Fastq

## the meta file describing the experiment settings
METAFILE: /shared/projects/YourProjectName/RASflow_EDC/configs/metadata.tsv

## paths for intermediate final results
BIGDATAPATH: /shared/projects/YourProjectName/RASflow_EDC/data # for big files
RESULTPATH: /shared/projects/YourProjectName/RASflow_EDC/results

## is the sequencing paired-end or single-end?
END: pair  # "pair" or "single"

## maximum number of cores you want to allocate to one job of the workflow (mapping and feature counting)
NCORE: 32 

## maximum number of jobs running in parallel
NJOBS: 100

# ================== Configuration for Quality Control ==================

## All required params have already been defined in the public params

# ================== Configuration for trimming ==================

## Number of trimmed bases
## put "no" for TRIM3 and TRIM5 if you don't want to trim a fixed number of bases. 
TRIM5: no #  integer or "no", remove N bp from the 5' end of reads. This may be useful if the qualities were very poor, or if there is some sort of unwanted bias at the 5' end.
TRIM3: no # integer or "no", remove N bp from the 3' end of reads AFTER adapter/quality trimming has been performed.

# ================== Configuration for quantification using transcriptome ==================

## transcriptome file
TRANS: /shared/.. # not yet implemented

# ================== Configuration for alignment to genome and feature count ==================

## aligner
ALIGNER: HISAT2 # "STAR" or "HISAT2"

## genome and annotation files
INDEXPATH: /shared/banks/homo_sapiens/hg38/hisat2 # folder containing index files
INDEXBASE: genome # for hisat2, base of the name of the index files (ie genome.1.ht2)
ANNOTATION: /shared/projects/YourProjectName/RASflow_EDC/gtf/gencode.v34.annotation.gtf # GTF file  

## bigwig option
BWSTRANDED: yes # "no": bw merging forward and reverse reads, "yes": get 2 bw files, one forward and one reverse; "both": get the two bw per strand as well as the merge one. 

## tool for feature count
COUNTER: featureCounts # "featureCounts" or "htseq-count" or "STARcount" (only with STAR aligner, --quantMode GeneCounts option) or "TEcount" (if REPEATS: yes)

## counting options
COUNTOPTIONS: "-M --fraction" # add extra options for the counter (for featureCounts or htseq-count only). 
# featureCounts: '-O' (set allowMultiOverlap to TRUE), '-M' (set countMultiMappingReads to TRUE), '--fraction'.
# htseq-count: -m <mode> ; --nonunique=<nonunique mode>; for instance "-m intersection-nonempty --nonunique=all" ... see https://htseq.readthedocs.io
ATTRIBUTE: gene_id  # the attribute used in annotation file. It's usually "gene_id", but double check that since it may also be "gene", "ID"...
STRAND: reverse # "no", "yes", "reverse". For stranded=no, a read is considered overlapping with a feature regardless of whether it is mapped to the same or the opposite strand as the feature. For stranded=yes and single-end reads, the read has to be mapped to the same strand as the feature. For paired-end reads, the first read has to be on the same strand and the second read on the opposite strand. For stranded=reverse, these rules are reversed.
FEATURE: transcript # "exon", "gene", "transcript", ... depending on your GTF file and on the feature you're interested in.
SPLITBY: 50000000 # To get efficient counting, the big bam files have to be split into smaller files. Put here the number of reads per sub-file. ie 50000000 for featureCounts, 20000000 for htseq-count. 

# ================== Configuration for repeat analysis ==================

GTFTE: /shared/projects/YourProjectName/RASflow_EDC/gtf/mm39_TE_rmsk.gtf # GTF ANNOTATION file for repeats, must be adapted to have the FEATURE you chose ("exon", "gene", "transcript") as 3rd column. 


# ================== Configuration for DEA ==================

## Do you want to start the workflow directly from the count tables obtained independently? If yes, give the path of your count tables. 
FROMCOUNTS: no   # put 'no' when using the whole workflow, or the path of your count tables. Format: one file / sample named {sample}_countGenes.tsv, 2 columns gene'\tab'count. 

## Do you want to use edgeR or DESeq2 to do DEA?
DEATOOL: DESeq2 # "edgeR" or "DESeq2"? DESeq2 is recommended for transcriptome-based DEA

## Is your experiment designed in a pair-wise way?
PAIR: no  # Is this a pair test or not? (yes or no). For instance 2 samples from the same patient taken at different times.

## the comparison(s) you want to do. If multiple comparisons, specify each pair (CONTROL & TREAT) in order respectively
CONTROL: ["J0_WT","J0_WT","J10_WT","J0_KO"]
TREAT: ["J0_KO","J10_WT","J10_KO","J10_KO"
## length of 'CONTROL' should agree with that of 'TREAT'
## what you fill in there should agree with the "group" column in metadata.tsv

FILTER: yes  # Filter out low expressed transcripts/genes or not? (yes or no) It's better to be set to "yes".


# ================== Configuration for visualization ==================

## All required params have already been defined in the public params
